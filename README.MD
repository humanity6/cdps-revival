# Real-Time Crime Detection and Prevention System

## Overview

This project aims to develop a comprehensive real-time detection system to enhance security and safety in various environments. By leveraging advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques, the system identifies potential threats and unauthorized activities, enabling proactive intervention and rapid response.

## Development Status

The detection backends for the following modules are implemented:

- [x] Violence detection
- [x] Weapon detection
- [x] ANPR
- [x] Unauthorized access and criminal detection

However, the system is still under development, with the following components in progress:

- [ ] Database integration
- [ ] Real-time alert system for notifications (e.g., via Telegram)
- [ ] Frontend interface for monitoring, configuration, and analytics

## Architecture

The system is designed with a modular architecture, allowing each detection module to operate independently while being coordinated through a central backend controller. This ensures scalability, ease of maintenance, and the ability to integrate additional modules in the future.
